        <p>Hey, I'm Adian and I'm a student at <strong>Santa Clara University</strong> studying <em><a href="https://www.scu.edu/engineering/academic-programs/department-of-computer-engineering/" target="_blank">Computer Science and Engineering</a></em>. Before starting at SCU and living in a dorm, I used to cook quite often. Some of my favorite things to cook were steak, pasta, and focaccia. I've yet to dive into making sourdough but I'll most likley try sometime soon.</p>
        <p>I'm not sure which field of CS I want to specialize in yet, so I'm just trying a bit of everything. This will be my first <em>complete</em> attempt at making a website.</p>
        <p>I'm only using HTML/CSS/JavaScript, but I plan on making a second website using a framework like React when I have another break.</p>
