        <p id="steakDesc">My favorite way to cook steak is in a cast iron pan because it retains heat so well. Compared to a non-stick pan or another generic pan, the temperature doesn't drop once you add your steak.
            This helps you form a good crust on the steak which adds a nice texture. You can certainly cook your choice of steak on a grill, but it might be harder to control the heat.

        <div id="steakNeeds">
            <p>Things you will need:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Steak of your choice, aim for 1.5" thickness</li>
                <li>Cast iron pan (preferred), any pan will do</li>
                <li>Olive oil, or any oil of your choice</li>
                <li><em>The Trio</em>: garlic salt, black pepper, and garlic powder</li>
                <li>Patience</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div id="steakSteps">
            <p>Steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Allow your steak to come up to temp by taking it out of your fridge 20-30 minutes prior to cooking.</li>
                <br>
                <li>When there are ~5 minutes left, get your pan on the stove and set it to high. <em>*make sure not to add oil during this step or else it will burn*</em></li>
                <br>
                <li>Pat your steak dry with paper towels to remove any excess moisture, this helps develop a crust.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Add a small amount of oil to help the seasoning stick. Then season with <em>The Trio</em> on both sides, and set it in the pan</li>
                <br>
                <li>Depending on the size, aim for 1-2 minutes per side before flipping. You can check the <em>doneness</em> on your steak by trying to make an indent with 
                    your finger. If it leaves an indent, it is still raw->blue. If it springs back extremely fast or it's firm, then it's medium well->well done. If it's somewhere in between, 
                    then it's most likely medium rare->medium.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Once you've reached your desired doneness, set aside uncovered for ~10 minutes. This will help the steak relax.</li>
                <br>
                <li>You can now cut, but make sure to cut it <strong>against the grain</strong>. Look for the grains of the steak and their direction, then cut perpindicular to the direction or in the opposite direction. You're essentially trying to make a + every time you cut. This helps with tenderness.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Enjoy!</li>
